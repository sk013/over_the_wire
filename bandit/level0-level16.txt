//The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)//

''''make a directory in /tmp and move data.txt in that folder''''
xxd -r data.txt > out
''''The -r switch of xxd convert an hexdump to binary. Then we use the file command to find out which compression tool has been used and recursively decompress the files with the right tool''''

level 13-->level 14

//The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on//

copy the key and ssh with that key as user bandit14

level 14-->level 15

//The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.//

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 | nc localhost 30000

//The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.
...Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command//

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15 | openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001 -ign_eof
